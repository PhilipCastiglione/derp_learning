# derp_learning

This repository contains the static site generation code for the [derp_learning](https://philipcastiglione.me/derp_learning/) website.

It uses Jekyll (the "Hacker" theme ðŸ˜Ž), GitHub Pages for site generation, deployment and hosting. It's all magic, all the way down!

## Contributing

If you have found an instance of machine learning (ideally deep learning) behaving badly you can create an issue suggesting its
inclusion as a post. Some reference to the original source is required.

## Run Locally

## TODO

Big:

* More content!
* Cross platform/browser testing
* Get people to use it
* Measure usage or something

Small:

* submit page fields and button look dumb on iOS
