# About

Derp Lerning is a celebration of the weird and wonderful results that
[deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) sometimes gives us
when we try to create something new.

It's also offered as an ambiguous and largely ineffectual counter for
singulatarians who believe that general AI is near.

If you like the site, remember to return and make a submission when you come
across something silly that belongs here.

Derp Lerning was created by
[Philip Castiglione](https://github.com/PhilipCastiglione) as some light relief
from the travails of attempting to make useful things.
