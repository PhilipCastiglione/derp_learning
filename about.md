# About

Derp Lerning is a celebration of the weird and wonderful results that
[deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) often gives us
when we create something new.

Derp Lerning was created by
[Philip Castiglione](https://github.com/PhilipCastiglione) as some light relief
from the travails of attempting to make useful things.
