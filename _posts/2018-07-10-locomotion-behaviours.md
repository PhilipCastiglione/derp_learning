title:  "Locomotion Behaviours Indeed"
---

DeepMind has done it again. A new paper has come out with a title so dry it's in
competition with the Sahara:
[Emergence of Locomotion Behaviours in Rich Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02286).
Technically impressive as always, this research demonstrates yet again how
effective reinforcement learning can be, sort of.

There are a number of versions of this video floating around with added
music and so on. Alongside the (presumably intentionally?) hilarious commentary,
I actually think the original is beautiful enough as it is. You may want to sit
down for this.
