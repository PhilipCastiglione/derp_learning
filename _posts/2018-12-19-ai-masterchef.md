title:  AI Masterchef Coming To You Soon
---

If you're a pathological masochist, maybe. BBC Future teamed up with research
teams from Stanford and Illinois Universities to provide a unique challenge for
AI recipe generators: how to deal with Christmas leftovers. The results were
pretty weird, as you'd expect.

After training a deep net with 60,000 recipes, the Stanford team AI came up with
crackers like:

> Spicy seafood casserole

> Leftovers: Smoked salmon, cheese, nuts, prawn cocktail

> Steps: In a skillet, heat oil, add bay leaf and onion. Saute onion and pepper
> until soft. Crumble finely diced salmon and add to the onion and pepper - stir
> to combine. Cover and cook over low until salmon is tender. Season to taste.
> Add shrimps and cheese into oyster pan, reduce heat. Makes enough sauce as cheese gravy.

> Additional ingredients added by model: chili peppers, cilantro, onion, oil, bay leaf
