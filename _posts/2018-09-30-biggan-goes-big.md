title:  "BigGAN: Big On Realism, Huge On Derp"
---

A recent GAN paper with the exciting title
[Large Scale GAN Training for High Fidelity Natural Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096)
has drawn some attention for high fidelity image generation, demonstrating
a new model named BigGAN boasting hyper-realistic texture synthesis, notable
improvements to stability and robustness and tennis balls that think they're dogs.

Seriously, this new model has produced some incredible results, at both ends
of the spectrum. Strap in and warm up your vision portholes...
