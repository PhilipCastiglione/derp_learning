Stanford and Google recently trained a CycleGAN to lie to them. More specifically,
researchers tried to build a system that would translate aerial photos to
street-view photos, then generate aerial photos from those that resembled the
originals.

_Wait, how did those trees get back there?_

In fact, they trained a system that translated aerial photos to
street-view photos ...secretly encoded visually imperceptible data that the GAN
used to generate approximations of the original aerial photos again. Naughty
little GAN!
