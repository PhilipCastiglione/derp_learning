title:  I Want To Get My Heart With You Too
---

[Janelle Shane](https://twitter.com/JanelleCShane) produces some amazing derp
learning content using neural networks and plaintext. I particularly liked some
of the "pickup lines" generated by this iteration.

Some of my favourites:

> "You are so beautiful that you know what I mean."

> "I want to get my heart with you."

> "You look like a thing and I love you."

> "I donâ€™t know you."

Have you ever heard anything so romantic?
